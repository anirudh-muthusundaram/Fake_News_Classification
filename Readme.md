Real/Fake News Classification Model

The aim of this project is to develop a classification model that can accurately distinguish between real and fake news articles. The model will utilize three different classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, and Random Forest.

The first step in the project will involve collecting a diverse dataset of news articles, including both real and fake news samples. This dataset will serve as the foundation for training and evaluating the classification models.

Next, the collected dataset will be preprocessed to extract relevant features from the text of the news articles. This may involve techniques such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and applying stemming or lemmatization to reduce word variations.

The project will then proceed to implement the Logistic Regression algorithm. Logistic Regression is a popular machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. It models the relationship between the features and the target variable using a logistic function, enabling the classification of news articles as either real or fake based on the extracted features.

After implementing the Logistic Regression model, the project will move on to the Decision Tree Classification algorithm. Decision trees are powerful and interpretable models that make decisions by recursively partitioning the feature space. This algorithm will learn a tree-like structure from the dataset, enabling the classification of news articles as real or fake based on the extracted features.

Finally, the project will employ the Random Forest algorithm. Random Forest combines multiple decision trees to create a robust and accurate ensemble model. By aggregating the predictions of individual decision trees, Random Forest can enhance the overall classification performance.

The performance of each model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
